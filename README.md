# ESP32_steppers
A project which uses ESP32 to control stepper motors using positional values via the AccelStepper library and TB6600 external stepper drivers. You can use any external stepper driver, just follow the pinout int he code.

This has a many areas of potential expansion to include IoT capabilities since the ESP32 can connect to WiFi.
